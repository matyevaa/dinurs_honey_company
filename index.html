							<p>It is well known what honey is a great replacer of sweets. Kyrgyzstan - or the Kyrgyz Republic - llocated in Central Asia is known as a perfect country for beekeeping. Export volumes of organic Kyrgyz honey are growing every year. Kyrgyz honey is produced in the north of the country, where the borders of three countries meet: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhastan and China. The prices of honey depend on its net cost and sort.</p>
			      			
							<center><img class="pics" src="images/beeskeeping.jpg"></center>

							<p>Beekeeping is a multilevel and complex process: working conditions are poor and the transportation is complicated due to the long distance. The quialitative organic honey collected in the mountains of the Chui Valley in Kyrgyzstan is world wide popular and rightfully takes the first place in the ranking among honey all around the world.</p>

							<center><img class="pics" src="images/bees.jpg"></center>

							<p>The main thing in honey is its quality: it must be confirmed by spceial labaratory research and expertise in mandatory certificated documents. Now Kyrgyzstan produces more than 500 tons of honey per year.</p>

			    			<p>Kyrgyzstan has thousands of honey plants. There are more than 100 sorts of honey. Only Kyrgyz beekeepers produce an elite sort - a white honey or honey-wound honey.</p>

			    			<center><img id="sorts2" src="images/sorts_honey.png"></center>

			    			<p>Kyrgyz beekeepers always experimentalise with the sorts. Today they offer customers several new sorts: honey with viburnum, barberry, currant and coconut. The most popular sort for today is honey with sea-buckthorn and milk. White clover or highland Pamir-Alai is considered to be the rarest sort of Kyrgyz honey: it is produced in small amount in the mountains, thus it is expensive and difficult to be transported and delivered. The same with the imported honey - Altai sunflower, Altai buckwheat and honey with special herbs. The price for them is set depending on the costs for transportation, production and delivery.</p>
